# R_Analysis

## Project Overview
Analysis for AutosRUs' new vehicle prototype, the MechaCar, on its specifications and manufacturing processes.The analysis includes creating a multiple linear regression, summary statistics table, t-tests, and a separate study about its horsepower performance.  R is used as the programming language to complete the analysis.  

## Resources
1. Data Source:
- MechaCar_mpg.csv
- Suspension_Coil.csv
- used_car_data.csv

2. Software:
- R

## Results
1. Multiple linear regression is used to predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes using a number of variable within MecaCar mpg dataset.  It led to results that the linear model is not considered to be zero because the p-value is 5.35e-11, which is smaller than the 0.05 significance level.
2. MechaCar suspension coil test results from multiple production lots.  The results indicated that Lot 1 and Lot 2 met the requirements, however Lot 3 does not meet the mean as the p-value is the only one that is smaller than 0.05 significance level.
3. A study was conducted to see if horsepower has an effect on mpg leading to better car performance.  To complete the study, a one sample t-test was computed, with the result that more horsepower effects the mpg.
