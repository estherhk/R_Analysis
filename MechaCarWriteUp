MPG Regression
According to the results of the analysis, vehicle length and ground clearance are statistically likely to provide non-random amounts of variance due to their significant impact on mpg.  Vehicle length has a Pr(>|t|) of 2.60e-12 and ground clearance has Pr(>|t|) of 5.21e-08.  The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because the p-value is 5.35e-11, which is smaller than the 0.05 significance level. This linear model predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively by roughly 71%.  This is determined because the r-squared value is 0.71. 

Suspension Coil Summary & T-Test
Comparing the results for the three lots, Lot 1 and Lot 2 meet the current manufacturing data specification; Lot 3 does not.  The reasoning is because the variance is 170, exceeding 100 pounds per inch.  To determine the mean population per lot, a t-test was computed.  The steps to compute a t-test are the following: 1) null hypothesis: Each lot's mean population result in 1,500 pounds per inch. alternate hypothesis: At least one of the lot's mean population does not result in 1,500 pounds per inch 2)  completed a one-sample t-test 3) Per Lot, resulted in p-values 1 (lot1), 0.6072(lot2), 0.04168(lot3). 4) Lot 1 and Lot 2 p-values are greater than the significance level, however, Lot 3 p-value is smaller than 0.05, 5) concluding the null hypothesis is rejected.  This also confirms that the mean of Lot 3 does not meet the 1,500 pounds per inch, whereas Lot 1 and Lot 2 do meet the 1,500 pounds per inch and are not statistically different. 

Own Study, Horsepower vs MPG
Consumers are interested in vehicles that have good performance.  Performance can be considered as horsepower having effects on mpg.  The null hypothesis: horsepower has no effect on mpg. Alternate hypothesis: horsepower has effect on mpg.  To compare the data, a t-test was computed based on the data table (mtcars).  Mtcars include data information of horsepower(hp), which is not available in MechaCar data. The one sample t-test rejected the null hypothesis that the slope is zero with a p-value of 1.788e-07. which is smaller than a 0.05 significance level.
